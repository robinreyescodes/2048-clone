# 2048-clone

## The What
This is a clone of the popular game, <i>2048</i> created by Gabriele Cirulli,
written in vanilla JavaScript with some CSS animations. Project completely 
strengthened knowledge/skills on asynchronous code, object-oriented programming,
and the use of modules. 

## The Why
I hadn't done too much with game development before this and wanted a little 
challenge after finishing up my online JavaScript course. The goal was to see
how much of the information I actually learned, and more importantly, retained.

## The How
Click on the github link in the description to run the game. Then start pressing arrow keys
and see the tiles move!
